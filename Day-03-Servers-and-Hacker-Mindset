-->What I Explored Today

-->Before today, I believed servers were simply machines that store data.
   But while learning more deeply, I realized servers play a much bigger role in how systems communicate and function.

-->I started by understanding how the client–server model works.
   One side requests information, the other responds — a simple idea that quietly powers most digital services.

-->As I explored further, I learned that servers are designed for different purposes.
   Each type of server handles a specific responsibility, which helps systems stay organized and efficient.

-->However, servers are not perfect.
   While they offer reliability, centralized control, and scalability, they also have limitations such as security risks, dependency issues, and performance challenges if mismanaged.

-->Alongside technical concepts, I also reflected on the human side of cybersecurity.

-->A hacker needs curiosity, logical thinking, and persistence.
   An ethical hacker carries all these qualities but adds responsibility, discipline, and respect for legal boundaries.

-->Key Reflection:-
   Cybersecurity is not only about understanding systems.
   It is about understanding strengths, weaknesses, and the mindset required to protect them responsibly.

These notes represent my learning from Day 3 of the 100 Days Ethical Hacking Challenge
