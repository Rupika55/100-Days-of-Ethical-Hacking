-->What I Explored Today

While using the internet daily, I never really questioned how data knows where to reach me.
Today’s learning answered that curiosity.

I explored the idea of IP addresses — not as numbers, but as digital identities that help devices identify and communicate with each other across networks.

I learned that IPs serve multiple purposes:
They help locate devices, manage communication, and organize network traffic.

Some IP addresses remain fixed, while others change dynamically.
This made me realize why network behavior can differ every time we connect.

I also understood how the internet evolved from IPv4 to IPv6 to handle the growing number of connected devices.

Another important realization was the difference between internal and external IPs.
Inside a network, devices use private IPs.
To the outside world, everything appears under a single public IP.

Even private IP ranges reveal insights.
By observing them, it’s possible to estimate whether a network is small, medium, or large.

-->Key Reflection

IP addresses quietly shape how networks function.
Understanding them helps in reading network behavior, scale, and structure — a crucial skill in cybersecurity.
